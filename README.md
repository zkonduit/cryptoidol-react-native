# CryptoIdol React Native Application

This is the **React Native** port of the website [cryptoidol.tech](https://cryptoidol.tech), designed to run on **iOS
17.5** and higher. The application leverages the power of on-device machine learning to assess users' singing skills and
allows them to mint a unique NFT based on their performance (coming soon).

**Recommended Device**: The app is optimized for **iPhone 15 Pro** or higher due to memory-intensive processes (RAM
requirement: 4GB+).

## Features

### 1. Record Your Singing üé§

With the CryptoIdol app, you can record your singing directly through your iPhone. The app captures and processes the
recording locally, ensuring privacy and efficiency. This is the core functionality of the app, providing a user-friendly
interface to showcase your talent.

### 2. Local Scoring with Machine Learning üß†

The app uses an on-device machine learning model to **evaluate the quality of your singing**. The scoring happens
entirely on your device, meaning your recording never leaves your phone, ensuring privacy. The score is based on factors
such as pitch, rhythm, and clarity, offering an objective measure of your performance.

### 3. Generate Cryptographic Proof of Your Score üîê

Once you have your score, the app allows you to generate a **cryptographic proof**
using [EZKL iOS Bindings](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl-swift-package). This proof ensures that your score is
authentic and has not been tampered with. The proof generation is performed locally, and this feature provides
transparency and trust in your singing score.

### 4. Mint a Unique NFT (Work in Progress) üé®

In future versions, the app will allow you to mint a **unique NFT** based on your singing score. This NFT will be
generated as a reward for your performance, creating a verifiable and unique asset representing your talent. The NFT
minting feature is currently in development and will be released in upcoming updates.

## Requirements

- **iOS Version**: 17.5 or higher
- **Recommended Device**: iPhone 15 Pro or higher (due to RAM requirements)
- **RAM Requirement**: 4GB+ for smooth processing of the machine learning model and proof generation

## Setup Instructions
